Description: build REST-style Web Services using Google Go
 Go-restful is a package for building REST-style Web Services using Google
 Go. REST asks developers to use HTTP methods explicitly and in a way
 that's consistent with the protocol definition. This basic REST design
 principle establishes a one-to-one mapping between create, read, update,
 and delete (CRUD) operations and HTTP methods.
